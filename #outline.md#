# Time Scavengers Science Communication Workshop: Writing Effective Alt-text

# What is alt-text?
- conveys meaning in photo or data visualization
- think about why you are including this picture or graph
- not identical to title or caption

# Where is alt-text?
- include instruction links
  - started in HTML code for websites
  - social media
  - MS Office
  - PDF

# Where isn't alt-text?
It has to be added deliberately
  - lots of websites
  - lots of sccial media posts, including science communication
  - academic journals mostly don't support alt-text yet

# How long is alt-text?
- it depends! social media or academic article?
- complexity of image
  
# Photos

## Context-dependent
## perspective, example is the search dog photo taken of dog's nose from *inside* the hiding place
## descriptive words - "mouth slightly open with tongue sticking out"
	### avoid words like beautiful, cute, adorable, breathtaking which don't convey information

## Examples and concepts from Sarah


# Data Visualization

#Alt-text FOr Data Visualizations## Ingredients for Data Visualization Alt-Text
1. description of type of graph, plot, chart
2. axis variables
3, scale of measurement
4. **what is the data showing?** Why are you including this? What is the meaning of this graph?

## Examples and concepts from Sarah


# Automatic solutions are usually incomplete

They can't articulate #4. Which is the whole reason you're displaying the graph!

# What to do when you don't have an alt-text slot?

Most scientific journals don't provide alt-text for figures. This may well be true for scientific media for general audiences.

Use words (probably in results section) to describe the relationships -- example from generalized additive models search dog paper

# Summary

Be aware of context.
Tell us why you included the image, including orienting and supporting details.
Write from scratch or carefully edit existing alt-text, making sure to include the answer to "what is this graph saying? Or "why did I include this picture?"
