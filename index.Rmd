# Today's Topics

- What is alt-text?
- Alt-text for Photos
- Alt-text for Graphs
- Alt-text for other data Visualizations
- Other aspects of accessibility (#a11y)

---

# Alt-text: What It Is

- Attached to images to provide a description for people who use screen reading software.
- Required to adhere to accessibility laws
- Crucial to make sure your science communication reaches everyone  

There are blind, low vision, and neurodivergent people in the general population, 
and there are blind scientists, even though we have not been visible.
---

# Alt-text: What It Does

Answers "Why was this image included?"

Examples: 
- It shows the relationship between X and Y in a graph
- It shows what a plant looks like
- It shows COVID-19 incidences on a map


---


# Alt-Text: What It Isn't

- **Automatically generated** by AI or text mining
- The title
- The caption
- Axis labels on a graph
- A humorous remark

These will usually not answer these questions:  
- "Why am I including this data visualization?"
- "What are the data saying?"

.footnote[
Humor is allowed, but it shouldn't obscure the message conveyed by the image
]
---

# Where is alt-text?


Started in [HTML code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute).  

Now appears in places like:  
- [MS Office](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-alternative-text-to-a-shape-picture-chart-smartart-graphic-or-other-object-44989b2a-903c-4d9a-b742-6a75b451c669)
- PDFs created with Office
- [PDFs created with Adobe Acrobat](https://csuf.screenstepslive.com/s/12867/m/96806/l/1474315-alt-text-for-images-in-adobe-acrobat-pdf)
- [Twitter posts](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)  
- [Facebook posts](https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/blog/how-add-alt-text-facebook-page)  
- R markdown [documents](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) and [slides](https://hugo-academic--silvia.netlify.app/2021-03-16-deploying-xaringan-slides/)

# Missing Alt-Text Infrastructure?  


.pull-left[
Places without alt-text infrastructure  

- academic journals
- books
- magazines  
- software that helps you create websites and blogs
]

.pull-right[
Workarounds  

- Provide descriptions in text, e.g. describe graphed relationship in Results section of a paper.
- Provide text descriptions of images as supplementary material when submitting to an academic journal.
- Use replies or comments in social media if you've forgotten alt-text
- Provide tables and/or raw data for data visualizations
]

# Alt-Text: How Long Is It?

*It depends!*  
- context  
- complexity  

Dr. Sheffield's examples in this presentation are too long by many standards, but they are perfect to convey the meanings of the images!

Use your judgement even though
- Some media have character limits for alt-text
- Too many guidelines emphasize brevity
- One or two sentences won't be enough for many data visualizations

---

# Alt-Text for Photos

- Context
- Perspective
- Foreground object(s)?
    - Shape
	- Color
    - Activity
	    - Expression

Dr. Sheffield's dog alt-texts sound like:  

"A cream colored dog with a brown ear snuggles under a blanket. Her tongue is sticking out slightly."

Can you see why this is so much better than "My dog is adorable?"

---

# Context/Perspective Example 1

Alt-text iteration 1:  

"A yellow dog with dark eyebrows and muzzle (possibly a German Shepherd?) edges peers down through a crack between rough splintery slats (possibly a produce crate or pallet?) Most visible are the dark nostrils of the snout, and the brown eyes behind.

# Context/Perspective Example 1

Alt-text iteration 2:

A yellow dog with dark eyebrows and muzzle edges peers down at the camera from above, through a crack between rough splintery slats (possibly a produce crate or pallet?) Most visible are the dark nostrils of the snout, and the brown eyes behind. Sunlight slants in across the dark slats at a steep angle. The ends of more pieces of wood are visible behind the dog. (Is this a SAR scenario?)

# Alt-Text For Data Visualization

Ingredients:
1. What kind of visualization is it (line graph, scatter plot, bar chart...?)
2. What variables are on the axes?
3. What is the range of the data?
4. What relationship between variables does the data visualization show?

Opinion: Don't waste my time with 1-3 if you aren't going to include 4. While some automatic
alt-text processes mine some of this information (e.g. R's ggplot2), I don't want to spend time with the metadata if I can't find out what the graph says.


---

# Link to the Data

Providing a link to the data set and/or an HTML-formatted data table allows the user to explore the data on their own.

Examples:
- COVID-19 incidence map by zip code with a table where the user can look up incidence by zip code
- A line graph accompanied by a data set allows the user to explore statistics like mean, median,
minimum, maximum, slope

---

# Data Visualization Example 1

Dr. Sheffield covering all the ingredients!   

.pull-left[
A graph marking diversity through time.  

X axis: geologic time   

y axis: number of marine families.   

The x axis spans from the Ediacaran to the Tertiary with the periods marked. Eons marked below. The Cambrian phase is marked, ending in Cambrian. Paleozoic phase stretches from Ordovician to Permian. Mesozoic- Cenozoic phase stretches from Triassic to Tertiary.   
]

.pull-right[
Diversity starts low- first big jump occuurs in Cambrian but a larger one occurs during Ordovician. The highest point in the Paleozoic reaches in Ordovician and stays there, except for the 2 major extinctions marked. At the Permian- Triassic, there is a large decrease, and it increases steadily to the end of the graph, except for extinction events.    

Each of the major mass extinctions are marked (5). 0 is marked as an extinction of Ediacaran biota (but there is no decrease in diversity- this is hypothesized, but not clear what occured). 
1: extinction at end of Ordovician. 2: Devonian extinction. 3: Permian extinction. 4: Triassic. 5: Cretaceous.

# Data Visualization Example 2: Phylogenetic Tree

# Data Visualization Example 2: Phylogenetic Tree

## Strategy

- Learn the vocabulary used in this kind of research (tree, branch, leaf, node)
- List categories of data (lifestyle and arm shapes)
    - Amount of information depends on whether terms are defined in accompanying text
- Work from most general to most specific
    - this provides context that is useful for comprehension

# Level Up! Other Kinds of Data Visualizations

## Diagrams and Infographics

These are more challenging to describe

- Provide general context
    - What kind of information?
	- Is it a display of data, a process, etc?
- Processes like flow charts can use a similar strategy to phylogenetic trees
- Is the image subdivided (see next slide with sections a-d)

# Objectivity

Report what you perceive about the data without judgement about what they mean.

Don't   
- make assumption about whether values are "good" or "bad" (Jung et al, 2021)  
- express opinions about variables (Jung et al, 2021; Lundgard et al, 2021)
- judge whether a change is small or large (Jung et al, 2021)
- conflate correlation with causation

# Summary

- Understand your context  
- Tell your reader the meaning the picture or visualization conveys  
    - Ask yourself why you're including the data visualization in your media
- Automatic alt-text is not complete, so write your own or edit


---

# Other Aspects of Accessibility to COnsider

- Use colors that can be distinguished by people with color blindness
([WebAIM Visual Disabilities: Color Blindness](https://webaim.org/articles/visual/colorblind))
- Ensure sufficient contrast and text size ([WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker))
- Flashing, movement can trigger migraines and seizures
([WebAIM Seizure and Vestibular Disorders](https://webaim.org/articles/seizure/))
- Avoid cognitive complexity
([Mozilla Cognitive Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Cognitive_accessibility))
- For web sites: ensure that if the image can be navigated (like a map), this can be done with the keyboard and not only with the mouse
